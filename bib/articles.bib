	journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
	abstract = {A description is provided of the software algorithms developed for the CMS tracker both for reconstructing   charged-particle trajectories in proton-proton interactions and for using   the resulting tracks to estimate the positions of the LHC luminous region and individual primary-interaction   vertices. Despite the very hostile environment at the LHC, the performance obtained with these algorithms is found to   be excellent. For tt̄ events under typical 2011 pileup conditions,   the average track-reconstruction efficiency for promptly-produced charged particles with transverse momenta of   pT &gt; 0.9GeV is 94% for pseudorapidities of |η| &lt; 0.9 and 85% for 0.9 &lt; |η| &lt; 2.5. The   inefficiency is caused mainly by hadrons that undergo nuclear interactions in the tracker material. For isolated muons, the   corresponding efficiencies are essentially 100%.   For isolated muons of pT = 100GeV emitted at |η| &lt; 1.4,   the resolutions are approximately  2.8% in pT, and respectively, 10μm and 30μm in the transverse and longitudinal   impact parameters.   The position resolution achieved for reconstructed primary vertices that correspond to interesting pp   collisions is 10–12μm in each of the three spatial dimensions. The tracking and vertexing software is fast and flexible,   and easily adaptable to other functions, such as fast tracking for the trigger, or dedicated   tracking for electrons that takes into account bremsstrahlung.}
