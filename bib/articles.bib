	abstract = {A description is provided of the software algorithms developed for the CMS tracker both for reconstructing   charged-particle trajectories in proton-proton interactions and for using   the resulting tracks to estimate the positions of the LHC luminous region and individual primary-interaction   vertices. Despite the very hostile environment at the LHC, the performance obtained with these algorithms is found to   be excellent. For tt̄ events under typical 2011 pileup conditions,   the average track-reconstruction efficiency for promptly-produced charged particles with transverse momenta of   pT &gt; 0.9GeV is 94% for pseudorapidities of |η| &lt; 0.9 and 85% for 0.9 &lt; |η| &lt; 2.5. The   inefficiency is caused mainly by hadrons that undergo nuclear interactions in the tracker material. For isolated muons, the   corresponding efficiencies are essentially 100%.   For isolated muons of pT = 100GeV emitted at |η| &lt; 1.4,   the resolutions are approximately  2.8% in pT, and respectively, 10μm and 30μm in the transverse and longitudinal   impact parameters.   The position resolution achieved for reconstructed primary vertices that correspond to interesting pp   collisions is 10–12μm in each of the three spatial dimensions. The tracking and vertexing software is fast and flexible,   and easily adaptable to other functions, such as fast tracking for the trigger, or dedicated   tracking for electrons that takes into account bremsstrahlung.}

It arranges the slow optical trigger links from the detector chambers into faster links (10 Gbps) that are sent in multiple copies to the track finders. Results from collision runs, that confirm the satisfactory operation of the trigger system up to the output of the barrel track finder, will be shown.}

The design architecture is based on twelve MP7 cards each of which uses a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA and can receive and transmit data at 10 Gbps from 72 input and 72 output fibers. According to the CMS Trigger Upgrade TDR the BMTF receives trigger primitive data which are computed using both RPC and DT data and transmits data from a number of muon candidates to the upgraded Global Muon Trigger. Results from detailed studies of comparisons between the BMTF algorithm results and the results of a C++ emulator are also presented. The new BMTF will be commissioned for data taking in 2016.}

	abstract = {Weak and electromagnetic interactions of the leptons are examined under the hypothesis that the weak interactions are mediated by vector bosons. With only an isotopic triplet of leptons coupled to a triplet of vector bosons (two charged decay-intermediaries and the photon) the theory possesses no partial-symmetries. Such symmetries may be established if additional vector bosons or additional leptons are introduced. Since the latter possibility yields a theory disagreeing with experiment, the simplest partially-symmetric model reproducing the observed electromagnetic and weak interactions of leptons requires the existence of at least four vector-boson fields (including the photon). Corresponding partially-conserved quantities suggest leptonic analogues to the conserved quantities associated with strong interactions: strangeness and isobaric spin.}

Both searches converge to the same events, which have the signature of a two-body decay of a particle of mass ∼80 GeV/c2. The topology as well as the number of events fits well the hypothesis that they are produced by the proces p̄+p→W±+X, with W± →e±+ν; where W± is the Intermediate Vector Boson postulated by the unified theory of weak and electromagnetic inter- actions.}

The search is performed in five decay modes: γγ, ZZ, W+W−, τ+τ−, and bb¯. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, γγ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3±0.4(stat.)±0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.}

	abstract = {A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton–proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb−1 collected at s=7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb−1 at s=8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H→ZZ(⁎)→4ℓ, H→γγ and H→WW(⁎)→eνμν in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H→ZZ(⁎), WW(⁎), bb¯ and τ+τ− in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H→ZZ(⁎)→4ℓ and H→γγ channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0±0.4(stat)±0.4(sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7×10−9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.}

We discuss the problems which this non-dynamical time causes in general relativity, a theory characterized by a local dynamical spacetime.}
