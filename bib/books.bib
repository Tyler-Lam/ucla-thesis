The level of discussion is aimed at readers who are familiar with the Standard Model and quantum field theory, but who have little or no prior exposure to supersymmetry. Topics covered include: motivations for supersymmetry; the construction of supersymmetric Lagrangians; supersymmetry-breaking interactions; the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM); R-parity and its consequences; the origins of supersymmetry breaking; and the mass spectrum of the MSSM. }
