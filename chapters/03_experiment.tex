\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a circular collider sharing the border between France and Switzerland, based at the European organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The central features of the LHC are the two superconducting rings, located about 100 m underground with a circumference of 27 km, designed to collide counter-rotating beams of protons or heavy ions at highly relativistic energies.
