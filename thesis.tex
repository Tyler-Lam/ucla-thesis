\abstract{
This thesis describes the search for rare Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson decays to long-lived scalar bosons ($\Phi$) decaying to photon pairs using data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The data were collected from 2016, 2017, and 2018 proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ and correspond to an integrated luminosity of $138\unit{fb^{-1}}$. Although the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter has limited vertex reconstruction capabilities for photons, this analysis utilizes a novel reconstruction technique using kinematic constraints to calculate the displaced vertices of the diphotons. Signal is extracted using a counting-based maximum-likelihood approach in bins of the diphoton vertex \lxy and the invariant photon mass. Results are interpreted in terms of upper limits on branching ratios $\mathcal{BR}(\PH\to\Phi\Phi)\times\mathcal{BR}(\Phi\to\PGg\PGg)$ and in terms of the model independent production cross section $\sigma(\PZ+\Phi\Phi)\times\mathcal{BR}(\Phi\to\PGg\PGg)$. No significant excess above SM expectation is observed. We also detail the real-time muon track finding algorithm used in the Level-1 Trigger at CMS.
